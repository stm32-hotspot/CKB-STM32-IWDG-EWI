# IWDG early wakeup interrupt in Stop modes for STM32U535/545/59x/5Ax/5Fx/5Gx.

This project demonstrates how to configure and use the Independent Watchdog (IWDG) in STM32U5 series microcontrollers to generate an Early Wakeup Interrupt (EWI).
 The EWI is used to perform specific safety operations or data logging before the watchdog reset is triggered. The project also shows how to exit from stop modes with an interrupt.
For a more detailed explanation of the use case and additional information, please refer to the article: [IWDG early wakeup interrupt in Stop modes for STM32U535/545/59x/5Ax/5Fx/5Gx.](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus/iwdg-early-wakeup-interrupt-in-stop-modes-for-stm32u535-545-59x/ta-p/716134).
